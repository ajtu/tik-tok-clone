1st iteration of video scrolling:   
We see some issues with:    
[ ] Improper Top and Bottom Spacing on larger iPhones  
[x] Cells not in focus need to be paused  
[x] Previous cells are backgrounds of new ones (very evident when scrolling from portrait into landscape)  
[x] Videos don't loop    
[x] Videos freeze sometimes

2nd iteration of video scrolling:     
[x] Track visible cells to display/pause correct videos  
[x] Give snapping behavior of each cell (custom UICollectionViewFlowLayout)
